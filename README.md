Repository that hosts backend code for Koinfolio.

## Update: Project no longer in development.

This repository is no longer actively developed. Koinex now has an Android app which I can use to see my portfolio, so there's that.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ - I've decided to spend my time on better things.

Anyway, the basic API is ready, if someone ever want to build something on top of this. I'd recommend building a better authentication system - I didn't know better when I was making this. API docs can be found [here](https://github.com/umanghome/koinfolio-backend/tree/master/api).
